title: "About me"
---
Hey there! I am a graduating student at the University of Toronto Mississauga. My programs of study include Political Science, Historical Studies, & Global Perspectives. My interests and works cover a number of topics within International Relations and contemporary Atlantic History. This includes but is not limited to conflict studies, democratic studies, American history and culture, political theory, and comparative foreign policy.

My current project is utilizing multivariate data sets such as the [*Cross-National Time Series*](https://www.cntsdata.com/), [*Varieties of Democracy*](https://v-dem.net/), and others to more effectively operationalize political instability in empirical studies of civil war.

Outside of school, I enjoy reading (more politics & history books!), watching tv shows, skating, and watching hockey.
